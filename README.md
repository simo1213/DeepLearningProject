Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking

This repository presents a technical study and implementation of Multi-Camera Multi-Target (MCMT) vehicle tracking based on the ELECTRICITY framework, with a primary focus on Vehicle Re-Identification (ReID) and cross-camera identity association.

The project evaluates tracking performance across synthetic and real-world environments and analyzes the domain gap between simulation and real traffic scenes.
